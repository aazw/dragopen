Linkclump was shut down in December 2024.

> This extension is no longer available because it doesn't follow best practices for Chrome extensions.  

The author has explicitly stated that they will not follow up on this matter.  
https://github.com/benblack86/linkclump/issues/250

> Chrome is evolving, and it's time to retire Linkclump. While I haven't officially endorsed an alternative, I encourage you to research and choose a replacement that best fits your needs.
